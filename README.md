# 💫 My Three.Js Portfolio

### 🔗Link https://dimisite.netlify.app/

# 💡 Main Idea
<h2> My goal was to make a 3d Portfolio with React Three Fiber and Three.js. I wanted a small room with 4 different "biomes" on each corner. 
I wanted to have "Experience", "Projects", "About Me" and "Contact" sections with different environment. </h2>

# 🏗️ Structure
<h2> We have three main things for the structure </h2>

### 1. Navigation - Used for navigation around the corners by clicking a single button.

### 2. Projectors - Used for revealing the content of the section
